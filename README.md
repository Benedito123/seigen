# Seigen: Seismology through code generation

## Overview

[Seigen](http://www.opesci.org) is an elastic wave
equation solver for seimological problems based on the
[Firedrake](http://www.firedrakeproject.org) finite element
framework. It forms part of the [OPESCI](http://www.opesci.org)
seismic imaging project.

## Quickstart

Seigen requires the installation of Firedrake and must be run from
within the Firedrake virtual environment. To first install Firedrake
please follow these [install
instructions](http://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html#).

Once Firedrake is installed and the venv is activated, you can install
Seigen using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/opesci/seigen.git
pip install -e seigen
```
