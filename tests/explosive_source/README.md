# Summary

This test case considers the propagation of waves in a 2D rectangular domain following an explosion at a point source, based on the work by Garvin (1956; doi:10.1098/rspa.1956.0055).

To run this simulation, execute "python explosive_source_lf4.py" at the command line. To plot the results and generate figures, run "python uy.py".
